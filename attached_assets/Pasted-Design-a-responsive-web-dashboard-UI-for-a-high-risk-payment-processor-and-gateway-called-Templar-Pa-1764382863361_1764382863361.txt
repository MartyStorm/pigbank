Design a responsive web dashboard UI for a high-risk payment processor and gateway called Templar Payments.

Overall vibe:

Clean, modern fintech style (similar to Stripe / Bankful / Acorns).

Color system based on a green + dark gray palette (I will plug in exact hex codes later).

Use a dark vertical sidebar and a light main content panel with subtle green gradients.

Flat, geometric, minimal style with small, tasteful shadows and smooth rounded corners.

Brand feel:

Templar = knight / shield / protector of merchants.

Interface should feel trustworthy, secure, sharp, and modern.

No cartoony elements; lean toward professional fintech aesthetics.

Layout

1. App Shell

Full-width desktop dashboard layout.

Left: fixed vertical sidebar.

Top of content area: horizontal header bar with:

Page title (e.g., “Transactions” or “Dashboard”).

Date range picker.

User avatar / profile dropdown (company name + email).

Small notification/bell icon.

Main content area below the header with:

Filters and summary cards at the top.

Data table and charts beneath.

2. Sidebar Navigation

Create a dark sidebar with our logo at the top (use a simple knight / shield placeholder icon) and these items in order:

Dashboard

Transactions

Virtual Terminal

Customers

Invoices & Subscriptions

Payouts

Disputes & Chargebacks

Reports & Analytics

Fraud & Risk

Terminals (Coming Soon) → style this as a disabled/inactive item

Crypto Payments (Coming Soon) → also disabled/inactive

Developers / API

Settings

Use a clear “active” state (highlight color or pill) for the selected menu item.

3. Dashboard (high-level view)

Design a dashboard screen with:

A top row of summary cards (4 cards):

Today’s Volume

Month-to-Date Volume

Approval Rate

Chargeback Rate

Each card should:

Use green accents for positive metrics.

Show a small trend indicator (up/down arrow with %).

Below that, two side-by-side sections:

Left: Line or area chart “Processed Volume Over Time”.

Right: Bar chart or donut chart “By Payment Method” (Card, ACH, Terminals, Crypto [placeholder]).

4. Transactions Page (primary working screen)

This is the main page we care about. Build it out in more detail:

Header & filters:

Page title: “Transactions”

Right side button: “Download CSV”

Filter bar with:

Date range picker.

Dropdowns for:

Status (All, Approved, Declined, Refunded, Pending)

Payment Method (Card, ACH, Terminal, Crypto)

Fraud Risk (Low, Medium, High)

Search input for Transaction ID, customer name, or email.

Data table:
Create a wide transaction table with the following columns:

Transaction ID

Date & Time

Customer Name

Amount

Method (Card / ACH / etc.)

Status (Approved, Declined, Refunded, Pending) with colored pills

Fraud Risk (Low/Med/High) with colored badges

AVS/CVV (Matched / Not Matched)

Actions (View, Refund)

Each row should have:

Hover state.

Clicking a row opens a slide-out drawer or modal on the right with detailed info.

Transaction detail drawer:
Include grouped sections:

Summary: Amount, status pill, method, last 4 of card, currency.

Customer Info: Name, email, phone, billing address.

Risk & Security: Fraud risk level, AVS/CVV result, IP country, device info.

Actions: Refund button, “Mark as Reviewed”, “Export Receipt”.

5. Customers Page

Simple first version:

Search bar at top.

Table with columns: Customer Name, Email, Total Volume, Total Transactions, First Seen, Last Seen, Risk Level.

Clicking a customer opens a profile drawer with their transactions and notes.

6. Payouts Page

Summary cards: Next Payout Date, Amount in Transit, Last Payout.

Table: Payout ID, Date, Amount, Status, Destination (Bank name / last 4), Type (Daily/Weekly).

7. Fraud & Risk Page

At the top: Risk Score summary + small explanation.

Cards for:

Total flagged transactions this month.

Chargebacks this month.

Table of recent flagged transactions with status, risk level, and reason.

Simple toggle UI for rules (e.g., “Block high-risk countries”, “Require CVV”, etc.) – purely visual for now.

8. Developers / API Page

Simple clean layout with:

API keys (masked with “Reveal” button).

Webhook URL list.

Example code block showing a fake API request.

Design should feel technical and minimal.

9. Visual & Style Details

Typography: clean sans-serif, Stripe-like.

Color:

Sidebar: very dark green / charcoal.

Primary accents: bright medium green.

Gradients: soft circular or diagonal green gradients behind hero sections or header.

Buttons:

Primary: solid green with white text.

Secondary: outline or ghost buttons.

Tables & cards:

Rounded corners.

Subtle borders, not heavy lines.

Icons: simple line icons for navigation and status where helpful.
