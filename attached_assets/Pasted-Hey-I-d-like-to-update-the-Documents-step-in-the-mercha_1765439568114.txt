Hey! I’d like to update the Documents step in the merchant application so it matches a more modern Stripe-style flow.

Right now that step has:

“Articles of Incorporation”

“Voided Check or Bank Letter”

I want to:

1. Keep the business formation doc as-is

Card 1 (unchanged, just slightly clearer text)

Title: Articles of Incorporation / Operating Agreement

Subtitle: LLC Operating Agreement, Corporate Bylaws, or equivalent

Keep the Upload button behavior the same.

2. Replace “Voided Check or Bank Letter” with modern bank verification text

Card 2 (edit this one):

New title: Bank Account Verification (Optional Upload)

Subtitle/body text:

Upload any one of the following to help us verify the account where payouts will be sent:
• Bank letter showing business name, routing number, and account number
• Recent business bank statement (first page only)
• Screenshot from online banking that clearly shows business name + routing + account number
• Optional: voided business check (if you have one)

Keep the Upload button but make this card visually marked as optional (e.g., small “Optional” tag in the top-right corner).

3. Add global explainer text above the cards

Above the two document cards, replace the current description with something like:

Documents
These documents help us verify your business and payout account for underwriting.

Business formation documents are required.
Bank account documents are optional because we’ll also verify your bank via two small “micro-deposits.”

4. Add a short note at the bottom of the step about micro-deposits

At the bottom of the Documents step (just above the Previous/Continue buttons), add:

How we verify your bank account
After you enter your routing and account number in the “Bank & Payouts” step, PigBank will send two small deposits to that account. Once they arrive, you’ll confirm the amounts in your dashboard to complete bank verification.

All uploaded documents are encrypted and stored securely for underwriting only.

No changes needed to navigation (still Step 5 of 6 etc.) — this is just copy + labeling changes on this tab.

That’s all I need on this screen for now. The idea is:

Formation docs = required

Bank docs = optional helper evidence

We explain that micro-deposits are the primary verification method, similar to Stripe.

Let me know if anything in the current layout makes this tricky and suggest the cleanest alternative if so
